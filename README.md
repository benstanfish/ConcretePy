# ConcretePy

This project is intended to develop a series of code modules to perform concrete analysis and design capabilities.

The primary code basis is the ACI 318 (US), however we're working on adding some functionality for JIS materials (Japan)

## STATUS

The current focus is a refactor that feeds into the **rccolumn.py** module, which is used for creating **PM diagrams** of columns and walls in the elastic range.
